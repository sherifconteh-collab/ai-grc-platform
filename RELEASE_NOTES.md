- No unreleased changes yet.

## [2.8.5] — 2026-03-30

> **Released:** 2026-03-30

### Changed
- Bump axios to ^1.14.0 in both backend and frontend ([#106](https://github.com/sherifconteh-collab/ai-grc-platform/pull/106), [#113](https://github.com/sherifconteh-collab/ai-grc-platform/pull/113))
- Bump @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to ^1.28.0 in backend ([#112](https://github.com/sherifconteh-collab/ai-grc-platform/pull/112))
- Bump stripe to ^21.0.1 in backend ([#110](https://github.com/sherifconteh-collab/ai-grc-platform/pull/110))
- Remove unused geoip-lite dependency from backend (was incompatible with Node >=20 target)
- Bump lucide-react to ^1.7.0 in frontend ([#111](https://github.com/sherifconteh-collab/ai-grc-platform/pull/111))
- Bump recharts to ^3.8.1 in frontend with DashboardCharts type fixes ([#114](https://github.com/sherifconteh-collab/ai-grc-platform/pull/114))
- Bump TypeScript to 6.0.2 in frontend ([#109](https://github.com/sherifconteh-collab/ai-grc-platform/pull/109))
- Wire dashboard `getRecentActivity` client to pass query params to the existing `/dashboard/recent-activity` endpoint (backend supports `limit` only)

### Fixed
- Fix auth `getUserById` not decrypting encrypted email fields, causing ciphertext to appear in `/me` responses when PII encryption is active (synced from ControlWeave 2.8.10)
- Harden health endpoint to return generic "Database unavailable" instead of raw error messages (synced from ControlWeave)
- Fix platform admin provisioning to preserve existing passwords on restart when `PLATFORM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var is not set, instead of overwriting with a generated password (synced from ControlWeave)

## [2.8.4] — 2026-03-29

> **Released:** 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- Fix self-hosted installs defaulting to Pro by making Community Edition the server default until a valid license is activated.
- Fix the self-hosted root route opening on the public marketing page by routing unauthenticated users into an app-first sign-in and account-creation experience.
- Fix organization invite links in self-hosted deployments by adding a dedicated `/invite` acceptance flow that validates the token, creates the user account, and signs the invited user into the app.
- Fix noisy updater errors in local unpacked desktop validation runs by skipping auto-update checks when `app-update.yml` is not present.

### Changed
- Registration now follows the edition already active on the self-hosted server instead of presenting hosted Stripe tier selection during community/self-hosted signup.

## [2.8.3] — 2026-03-29

> **Released:** 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- Fix packaged desktop startup on Windows by shipping embedded PostgreSQL spawn targets outside `app.asar`, packaging backend runtime dependencies, and bundling the standalone Next.js runtime dependencies required by the desktop frontend server.
- Fix legacy desktop upgrade paths by reconciling older schema variants before normal migrations run, normalizing non-UTF8 migration input for older Windows desktop databases, and aligning TPRM migrations/routes with legacy table shapes.
- Fix packaged backend startup by generating desktop-scoped `JWT_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and `HMAC_KEY` values automatically and by skipping assessment-procedure seeding when no compatible packaged seed script is present.
- Fix packaged startup warnings from `express-rate-limit` by switching direct route limiters to IPv6-safe key generation.

### Changed
- Add packaged runtime preflight validation for embedded PostgreSQL binaries and required backend resources before desktop startup continues.
- Force UTF-8 initialization for new embedded PostgreSQL desktop clusters.
- Add macOS `.app` and Linux AppImage smoke tests to the desktop release workflow so packaged regressions are caught before GitHub release assets are published.

## [2.8.2] — 2026-03-28

> **Released:** 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- Fix Windows `.exe` smoke test timeout: validate bundled resources without starting embedded PostgreSQL, backend, or frontend servers in CI.

## [2.8.1] — 2026-03-28

> **Released:** 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- Fix Windows `.exe` desktop build job hanging for 6 hours in CI by adding job-level timeouts (Windows: 30 min, macOS/Linux: 20 min), step-level timeout on smoke test, and script-level 120-second process timeout.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-03-27

> **Released:** 2026-03-27

### Overview
- AI-code security hardening, backend ESLint enablement, ReDoS dependency remediation, frontend viewport support, and staging-environment documentation updates.

### New Features
- Backend ESLint configuration
- Staging environment documentation

### Added
- Backend ESLint configuration (`backend/eslint.config.js`) using flat config format with ESLint 9.x and `globals` for Node.js environment declarations.
- `STAGING_ENVIRONMENT.md` guide covering deployment architecture, environment variables, Docker-based local staging setup, and promotion workflow.

### Fixed
- Backend linting stays on ESLint 9.x flat config after the initial configuration was corrected during review.
- `globals` import usage is documented inline for editor-tooling clarity.
- Staging-environment tables render consistently in Markdown.

### Security
- `path-to-regexp` bumped to `0.1.13` for Express and `8.4.0` for `router`, resolving HIGH-severity ReDoS advisories in backend routing dependencies.
- Structured Express error handling now returns explicit client messages for 4xx responses while preventing 5xx internal-detail leakage from `server.js`.
- Frontend `layout.tsx` now exports mobile viewport metadata for proper scaling on small screens.

## [2.7.3] — 2026-03-26

> **Released:** 2026-03-26

### Overview
- Restores the missing v2.7.3 release entry and enriches retroactive release-note metadata for traceability and consistency.

### Changed
- Restored the v2.7.3 entry from a single-line placeholder to a fully detailed retroactive release-note summary.
- Release dates were added to documentation file headings.
- Internal release metadata was enriched with tag and release-branch fields for traceability.

---

## [2.7.2] — 2026-03-26

> **Released:** 2026-03-26

### Overview
- Improves release-notes automation quality and retroactively cleans up earlier generated entries so they match the detail level of hand-written notes.

### Changed
- Release-notes auto-generation now strips redundant type-prefix verbs and capitalizes 30+ GRC/tech acronyms.
- Auto-generated overview now handles singular/plural wording correctly and uses an Oxford comma when summarizing categories.
- Auto-generated release titles are derived from change categories and applied consistently to release-note headings.
- Conventional commit regex synced between release-notes and branch-naming workflows — added `migration` and `test` types.
- American English normalization applied across workflow files.

---

## [2.7.1] — 2026-03-26

> **Released:** 2026-03-26

### Added
- TEVV-API: 4 new behavioral tests — route `require()` + `.stack` verification, auth middleware import check, `module.exports` verification, frontend `api.ts` client coverage.
- TEVV-DB: Migration file SQL keyword validation.
- TEVV-UI: 7 new page-level tests covering `ai-security`, `assets`, `plot4ai`, `organization`, `my-organizations`, `report-issue`, and all 9 CMDB sub-pages.

### Changed
- Removed duplicate `security-reports-export.yml` and `security-reports-stig-quarterly.yml` workflows.
- Merged `sync-wiki.yml` and `wiki-health-check.yml` into `docs-pipeline.yml` with preflight routing.

### Fixed
- `security-pipeline.yml`: CodeQL language identifier corrected (`javascript` → `javascript-typescript`); `npm install` → `npm ci`.
- `codeql.yml`: Narrowed triggers to `schedule`/`workflow_dispatch` only.

---

## [2.7.0] — 2026-03-26

> **Released:** 2026-03-26

### Added
- NIST AI 800-4 compliance-layer monitoring with cross-feature navigation cards across 8 dashboard pages.
- `stateAiLawsAPI` added to frontend `api.ts` closing coverage gap on 4 backend routes.
- `validateCategorySync()` startup guard comparing DB CHECK constraints against JS constants.

### Fixed
- AI Monitoring and AI Governance sidebar visibility corrected — wrong `isVisible` gate and permission (`settings.manage` → `ai.use`).
- Division-by-zero guard added to `coverage_percentage` calculation.

---

## [2.6.0] — 2026-03-26

> **Released:** 2026-03-26

### Added
- Quantized GGUF model support for Ollama — configurable quantization levels for smaller memory footprints and faster local AI inference.

### Fixed
- Stale tier names on `/privacy` page.
- Missing `next/link` import and React type declarations in frontend components.

### Added
- Field-level AES-256-GCM encryption for user email addresses with HMAC-SHA-384 searchable index (migration 101).
- Startup-time CNSA Suite 1.0 encryption posture audit; hard-fails in production on compliance violations.
- Centralized password policy (`passwordPolicy.js`) with minimum length increased to 15 characters and complexity rules.
- Per-organization SMTP configuration via `organization_settings` table; falls back to env vars → platform settings.

### Changed
- Email lookups use `email_hash` column (HMAC-SHA-384) for O(1) lookup with lazy backfill on login.
- All email reads call `decrypt()`, all writes call `encrypt()` + `hashForLookup()`.
- Notification email sending now passes `orgId` through for per-org SMTP resolution.
- Frontend register page updated to enforce 15-character minimum password.

### Security
- CNSA Suite 1.0 compliance: encryption key-length check derives from actual key material.
- Register and accept-invite endpoints check both HMAC-hashed and unmigrated plain-text email rows to prevent duplicate accounts.

---

## [2.4.4] — 2026-03-22

> **Released:** 2026-03-22

### Fixed

### Added

#### 📋 AIUC-1 Agentic AI Certification Framework (v2.4.0)

> ✅ **Tier availability:** Community · Pro · Enterprise · Gov Cloud

ControlWeave supports **25+ compliance frameworks** out of the box. Community-tier organizations can activate up to 2 frameworks simultaneously and benefit from automatic crosswalk mappings between them.

- **`seed-aiuc1-framework.js`** — New seed script adding AIUC-1 as a supported compliance framework in ControlWeave. AIUC-1 is the first independently-audited certification standard purpose-built for agentic (autonomous) AI systems, developed by the Artificial Intelligence Underwriting Company (AIUC) with Schellman as the first accredited auditor.
- **31 controls** across six risk domains: Data & Privacy (DP-1–DP-6), Security (SEC-1–SEC-6), Safety (SAF-1–SAF-5), Reliability (REL-1–REL-5), Accountability (ACC-1–ACC-5), Societal Impact (SOC-1–SOC-5).
- **Crosswalk mappings** to NIST AI RMF 1.0, EU AI Act 2024, and ISO/IEC 42001:2023. OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 crosswalks included when that framework is pre-seeded.
> 🔗 **Crosswalk mapping** automatically surfaces overlapping controls across frameworks so you comply once and satisfy many.

- AIUC-1 added to `seed-frameworks.js` framework list with 13 core crosswalk pairs to existing AI governance frameworks.

- **AI Governance check** (`llmService.js`) updated to include `aiuc_1` alongside `eu_ai_act`, `nist_ai_rmf`, `iso_42001`, and `iso_42005`. Analysis prompt extended with AIUC-1 readiness assessment across all six domains.
- **Enterprise tier** — AIUC-1 gated at enterprise tier consistent with its use case (organizations deploying autonomous AI agents at scale).
- `npm run seed:aiuc1` — new seed script entry in `backend/package.json`.

> 💡 **Getting started:** Go to *Frameworks* in the sidebar → click *Activate* on any framework to begin.
#### 🔔 Self-Service Community License Generation & Admin Notification (v2.3.3)

> ✅ **Tier availability:** Community · Pro · Enterprise · Gov Cloud

**Notifications** keep your team aware of control status changes, assessment completions, and approaching due dates — delivered in-app and optionally via email.

- `licenseService.js`: added `generateCommunityKey(licensee, seats)` — generates a local RSA-2048 keypair, signs a community-tier JWT (perpetual, no `exp`), returns `{ licenseKey, publicKey }`. Private key is discarded after signing.
- `licenseService.js`: added `setLocalPublicKey(pem)` — stores a PEM public key in-module as fallback when `CONTROLWEAVE_LICENSE_PUBKEY` env var is not set. Used to verify self-generated keys.
- Migration `097_server_license_pubkey.sql`: adds `local_public_key TEXT` column to `server_license` — stores the public key from `generate-community` so self-signed keys survive server restarts without env var changes.
- New endpoint `POST /api/v1/license/generate-community` (platform owner only): generates, activates, and persists a community license key in one step.

> 💡 **Getting started:** Click the bell icon in the top-right corner to view and manage notifications.
#### 🔌 Community License Key Support & Self-Hosted License API (v2.3.2)

> ✅ **Tier availability:** Community · Pro · Enterprise · Gov Cloud

The **REST API** follows OpenAPI 3.1 and is fully documented at `/docs/openapi.yaml`. Every endpoint requires a JWT bearer token and respects your organization's tier limits.

- `licenseService.js`: Added `'community'` to `VALID_TIERS` — community-tier JWTs are now accepted by `validateLicenseKey()`.
- `edition.js`: Added `community: 'community'` to `LICENSE_TIER_TO_EDITION` — startup validation (`validateEdition()`) now correctly maps a community license to the community edition.
- New route `backend/src/routes/license.js` (`@tier: community`): provides `GET /api/v1/license` (current edition + persistence status) and `POST /api/v1/license/activate` (runtime license key activation with audit log).
> 🗂️ **Audit trail** entries are immutable and include the acting user, timestamp, affected resource, and change delta.

- Migration `096_server_license.sql`: new `server_license` table stores the activated key so it survives restarts.
- `server.js`: new `ensureLicenseFromDb()` startup function loads the DB-persisted license key and restores the edition automatically on restart.
- Frontend: `licenseAPI.getInfo()` and `licenseAPI.activate(key)` added to `src/lib/api.ts`.

> 💡 **Getting started:** See `docs/openapi.yaml` or run the local dev server and visit `http://localhost:3001/api-docs`.
